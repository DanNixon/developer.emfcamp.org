This is the documentation for all of the weird and wonderful APIs exposed by things at EMF.

{{% pageinfo color="danger" %}}
WARNING: THESE PAGES ARE FROM EMF 2022
{.h2 .text-center}

Some things may change or not be available at the 2024 event.

We are hoping to start updating the content on this site soon. (You can help out!)

## Help improve this!

If you know of an API that isn't documented here [please let us know](https://github.com/emfcamp/developer.emfcamp.org/issues),
or raise a [pull request](https://github.com/emfcamp/developer.emfcamp.org/pulls)
to add it.  If you're on a widescreen device, the links on the side of every
page to edit, create or raise an issue may be helpful.

To get support and chat about these APIs, join us in the [#emfcamp-developer IRC
channel](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#emfcamp-developer) on [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat/),
or in [#developer:emfcamp.org on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#developer:emfcamp.org).
These channels are bridged together, so you won't miss out on anything
whichever you choose.
