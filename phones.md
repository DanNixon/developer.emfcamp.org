# Programmable Communications

As part of the EMF Phone Operations Centre(POC) this year, we have a set of programmable communcations APIs that you can use to interact with the phone network and build your own services.

This is based on the open source [jambonz](jambonz.org) platform which has APIs for incomming and outgoing calls similar to some of the other programable communications platforms on the market. The key thing is that this one can call and be called from the EMF site phone network.

You can find the details on the API at https://www.jambonz.org/docs/ 

And you can configure an application at https://jambonz.emf.camp/signup Enter the name of your app, the URLs where you receive webhooks (see the docs) and your email address. The system will create an app, allocate you a phone number in the range 555 XXXX and email you the details.

Jambonz can place calls to other EMF phones but not out to the public phone network.

If you want to test your application prior to camp you can call it by dialling 0117 200 1500 then entering your applications number when prompted.

If you want to learn more you can come to our workshop on Programming the EMF Phone network with Jambonz and Node-RED see the schedule for details. 
Or come visit the POC in the info tent, you can also email us questions on poc@emfcamp.org



# Low-Code Tool
We  have a platform you can use to create your phone apps on or  non-phone apps that interact with the badge or any of the other APIs at EMF. 

Its provided by [FlowForge](https://flowforge.com) and allows you to run the open source [Node-REd](https://nodered.org) tool which privides low code programming for event driven applications. We'll be using it in our workshop about programming the phone network.

If you would like an account please email poc@emfcamp.org as we only have limited capactity.


# Stage Audio

Live audio from each of the stages is availbe on your phones by dialing the following numbers:

555 5001 - Stage A
555 5002 - Stage B
555 5003 - Stage C

Where a speaker has opted not to have their talk recorded then this feed will be unavailible

For quesitons on this API please email poc@emfcamp.org
